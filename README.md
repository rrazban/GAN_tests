# GAN_tests
Inspired by a lab in a Coursera course titled "Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow" by IBM (Module 4). Trying out tweaks (files are named `try1_`, `try2_`, etc...) to the default Generative Adversarial Network provided (`coursera_lab.ipynb`) to obtain better results on the MNIST dataset. 

Jupyter notebooks were run in the IBM Skills Network Labs environment as part of the Coursera course.
